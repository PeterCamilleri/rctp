# The Ruby Compiler Toolkit Project

Welcome. This project exists as a result of the conjecture that Ruby would be
an excellent language for writing compilers. This belief is based on the
observation that Ruby excels in handling complex data structures and
relationships in a simple, flexible, easier-to-understand way. This toolkit is
being developed for a number of reasons:

1. To test the Ruby Compiler Conjecture.
2. To build a platform that will permit others to develop compilers of
their own.
3. To demonstrate the principles of compiler design and construction without
all of the obscuring ceremony and boilerplate of more conventional languages.
4. To promote programming education and exploration.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rctp'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rctp

## Usage

WIP

## Contributing

#### Plan A

1. Fork it ( https://github.com/PeterCamilleri/rctp/fork )
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create a new Pull Request

#### Plan B

Go to the GitHub repository and raise an
 [issue](https://github.com/PeterCamilleri/rctp/issues)
calling attention to some aspect that could use some TLC or a suggestion or an
idea.
